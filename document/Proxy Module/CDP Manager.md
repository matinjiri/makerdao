### GetCdps Contract

The `GetCdps` contract is a utility contract designed to fetch information about Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) owned by a user.
It interacts with the `DssCdpManager` contract to retrieve CDP data in ascending or descending order.

### **Functions**

#### **getCdpsAsc**

- **Description**: Fetches all CDPs owned by a user (`guy`) in ascending order of their IDs.
    
- **Parameters**:
    
    - `manager`: Address of the `DssCdpManager` contract.
    - `guy`: Address of the user whose CDPs are being queried.
- **Returns**:
    
    - `ids`: Array of CDP IDs.
    - `urns`: Array of CDP urn addresses (representing the CDP state).
    - `ilks`: Array of collateral types (`ilk`) associated with each CDP.

Here's a detailed documentation for the two Solidity contracts you provided:

## **Contract: GetCdps**

The `GetCdps` contract is a utility contract designed to fetch information about Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) owned by a user in a MakerDAO-like system. It interacts with the `DssCdpManager` contract to retrieve CDP data in ascending or descending order.

### **Functions**

#### **`getCdpsAsc`**

- **Description**: Fetches all CDPs owned by a user (`guy`) in ascending order of their IDs.
    
- **Parameters**:
    
    - `manager`: Address of the `DssCdpManager` contract.
    - `guy`: Address of the user whose CDPs are being queried.
- **Returns**:
    
    - `ids`: Array of CDP IDs.
    - `urns`: Array of CDP urn addresses (representing the CDP state).
    - `ilks`: Array of collateral types (`ilk`) associated with each CDP.


#### **`getCdpsDesc`**

- **Description**:  Fetches all CDPs owned by a user (`guy`) in descending order of their IDs.

##  DssCdpManager Contract

The `DssCdpManager` contract manages CDPs. It allows users to create, transfer, and interact with CDPs and their associated collateral and debt.

### **State Variables**

- `vat`: Address of the MakerDAO `Vat` core contract.
- `cdpi`: Auto-incrementing counter for CDP IDs.
- Mappings:
    - `urns`: Maps CDP IDs to urn handler addresses.
    - `list`: Doubly linked list storing the previous and next CDP IDs for each CDP.
    - `owns`: Maps CDP IDs to their owner addresses.
    - `ilks`: Maps CDP IDs to their collateral type (`ilk`).
    - `first`, `last`, `count`: Track the first, last, and total number of CDPs owned by a user.
    - `cdpCan`: Permission mapping for managing CDPs.
    - `urnCan`: Permission mapping for managing urns.

### **Functions**
#### **`cdpAllow`**

`function cdpAllow(uint cdp, address usr, uint ok) public`

- **Description**: Grants or revokes permission for a user to manage a specific CDP.
- **Parameters**:
    - `cdp`: CDP ID.

#### **`urnAllow`**

`function urnAllow(address usr, uint ok) public`

- **Description**: Grants or revokes permission for a user to interact with the sender's urn.
- **Parameters**:
    - `usr`: Address to grant/revoke permission.
    - `ok`: `1` to allow, `0` to revoke.

#### **`open`**

`function open(bytes32 ilk, address usr) public returns (uint)`

- **Description**: Opens a new CDP for a user.
- **Parameters**:
    - `ilk`: Collateral type.
    - `usr`: Address of the CDP owner.
- **Returns**:
    - The ID of the newly created CDP.
#### **`give`**

`function give(uint cdp, address dst) public`

- **Description**: Transfers ownership of a CDP to another address.
- **Parameters**:
    - `cdp`: CDP ID.
    - `dst`: Address of the new owner.

#### **`frob`**

`function frob(uint cdp, int dink, int dart) public`

- **Description**: Adjusts the collateral (`dink`) and debt (`dart`) of a CDP.
- **Parameters**:
    - `cdp`: CDP ID.
    - `dink`: Amount of collateral to add/remove.
    - `dart`: Amount of debt to add/remove.
#### **`flux`**

`function flux(uint cdp, address dst, uint wad) public`

- **Description**: Transfers collateral from a CDP to a destination address.
- **Parameters**:
    - `cdp`: CDP ID.
    - `dst`: Destination address.
    - `wad`: Amount of collateral to transfer.
#### **`move`**

`function move(uint cdp, address dst, uint rad) public`

- **Description**: Transfers DAI (debt) from a CDP to a destination address.
- **Parameters**:
    - `cdp`: CDP ID.
    - `dst`: Destination address.
    - `rad`: Amount of DAI to transfer.
#### **`quit`**

`function quit(uint cdp, address dst) public`

- **Description**: Exits the system by transferring a CDP's collateral and debt to another urn.
- **Parameters**:
    - `cdp`: CDP ID.
    - `dst`: Destination urn address.

#### **`enter`**

`function enter(address src, uint cdp) public`

- **Description**: Imports a position from a source urn to a CDP's urn.
