The **`DSPause`** contract is a key component used for pausing operations and deferring actions in the MakerDAO system. It allows administrators to schedule actions (plans) and execute them with a delay, ensuring that critical system changes cannot be made instantaneously. The contract also supports the concept of a `proxy`, a separate contract responsible for handling the execution of delegated actions to prevent malicious modifications during the execution phase.


### **Functions**

#### **1. `constructor(uint delay_, address owner_, DSAuthority authority_)`**

The constructor initializes the `DSPause` contract with the given delay time, the address of the owner, and the contract's authority.

- **Parameters**:
    
    - `delay_`: The delay time (in seconds) between when a plan is scheduled and when it can be executed.
    - `owner_`: The address of the contract owner.
    - `authority_`: The authority contract that defines the permissions for certain actions.
- **Usage**:
    
    - The constructor initializes the contract with necessary parameters and deploys the `DSPauseProxy` contract, which is responsible for executing the actual operations.

#### **2. `setOwner(address owner_)`**

Sets the new owner of the contract. This function is only callable by the `proxy`.

- **Parameters**:
    
    - `owner_`: The address of the new owner.
- **Modifiers**:
    
    - `wait`: This modifier ensures that only the `proxy` can call this function.

#### **3. `setAuthority(DSAuthority authority_)`**

Sets the authority for the contract, which defines who can execute certain functions.

- **Parameters**:
    
    - `authority_`: The new authority contract.
- **Modifiers**:
    
    - `wait`: This modifier ensures that only the `proxy` can call this function.

#### **4. `setDelay(uint delay_)`**

Sets the delay time between when a plan is scheduled and when it can be executed.

- **Parameters**:
    
    - `delay_`: The new delay time.
- **Modifiers**:
    
    - `note`: Emits an event when the delay is changed.
    - `wait`: Ensures only the `proxy` can call this function.

#### **5. `add(uint x, uint y)`**

A helper function to safely add two numbers, ensuring there is no overflow.

- **Parameters**:
    
    - `x`: The first value.
    - `y`: The second value.
- **Returns**:
    
    - The sum of `x` and `y`.
- **Usage**:
    
    - Used internally in the contract to prevent overflow when performing addition.

#### **6. `hash(address usr, bytes32 tag, bytes memory fax, uint eta)`**

Generates a unique hash for a plan, which can be used to track and validate a specific action.

- **Parameters**:
    
    - `usr`: The user address associated with the plan.
    - `tag`: The tag identifying the action.
    - `fax`: The calldata for the action to be executed.
    - `eta`: The estimated time of execution.
- **Returns**:
    
    - A `bytes32` value representing the unique hash of the plan.

#### **7. `soul(address usr)`**

Returns the code hash of a contract at a specified address.

- **Parameters**:
    
    - `usr`: The user address whose code hash is being checked.
- **Returns**:
    
    - The `bytes32` value representing the code hash of the contract at the given address.

#### **8. `plot(address usr, bytes32 tag, bytes memory fax, uint eta)`**

Schedules a plan by specifying the action, the user, and the time of execution. The action is validated to ensure that it is not executed before the delay.

- **Parameters**:
    
    - `usr`: The user address initiating the plan.
    - `tag`: A tag identifying the action.
    - `fax`: The encoded calldata for the action to be executed.
    - `eta`: The estimated time of execution.
- **Modifiers**:
    
    - `note`: Emits an event for the action.
    - `auth`: Ensures the caller is authorized.

#### **9. `drop(address usr, bytes32 tag, bytes memory fax, uint eta)`**

Cancels a previously scheduled plan.

- **Parameters**:
    
    - `usr`: The user address associated with the plan.
    - `tag`: The tag identifying the action.
    - `fax`: The calldata for the action.
    - `eta`: The time the plan was scheduled.
- **Modifiers**:
    
    - `note`: Emits an event for the action.
    - `auth`: Ensures the caller is authorized.

#### **10. `exec(address usr, bytes32 tag, bytes memory fax, uint eta)`**

Executes a scheduled plan after confirming that it can be safely executed. The function checks whether the plan is properly scheduled, ensures the userâ€™s contract matches the expected code hash, and validates that the execution time has passed.

- **Parameters**:
    
    - `usr`: The user address associated with the plan.
    - `tag`: The tag identifying the action.
    - `fax`: The calldata for the action to be executed.
    - `eta`: The estimated time of execution.
- **Returns**:
    
    - The output of the executed action.
- **Modifiers**:
    
    - `note`: Emits an event for the action.



### **Data**

- **`plans`**: A mapping of `bytes32` to `bool` indicating whether a specific plan is scheduled.
- **`proxy`**: The address of the associated `DSPauseProxy` contract responsible for executing actions.
- **`delay`**: The delay time (in seconds) that must elapse before a scheduled plan can be executed.


## **DSPauseProxy Contract 

The **`DSPauseProxy`** contract is used by the **`DSPause`** contract to execute delegated calls.
