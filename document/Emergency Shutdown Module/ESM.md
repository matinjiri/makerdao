The `ESM` contract is part of a system designed to allow for the emergency shutdown of a decentralized system. It manages permissions, handles collateral, and ensures that specific system components (like the proxy) can be disabled when necessary.

### **Key Variables**:

- **`gem`**: A reference to the token or collateral used in the system (e.g., MKR token).
- **`proxy`**: The address of the pause proxy, which has the ability to trigger the shutdown.
- **`sum`**: A mapping that tracks the balances of users who interact with the system (join).
- **`Sum`**: A total balance representing the sum of all balances from users who have joined the system.
- **`min`**: The minimum threshold balance that must be met before triggering an emergency shutdown.
- **`end`**: A reference to the `EndLike` interface, used for interacting with the system’s shutdown module.

#### 1. **`revokeGovernanceAccess`**:

- **Purpose**: Returns whether the contract has a `proxy` address. This helps check if the system has the ability to revoke governance access.

#### 2. **`fire`**:

- **Purpose**: Triggers the emergency shutdown of the system.
    - Verifies that the total balance (`Sum`) exceeds the minimum threshold (`min`).
    - If a `proxy` is set, it calls `DenyLike(end.vat()).deny(proxy)` to revoke the proxy’s permissions.
    - Calls `end.cage()` to shut down the system.

#### 3. **`denyProxy`**:

- **Purpose**: Revokes the proxy’s permissions for a specific target contract.
    - Only callable when the system is active, and the total balance exceeds the minimum threshold.

#### 4. **`join`**:

- **Purpose**: Allows a user to contribute collateral (e.g., MKR tokens) to the system.
    - Updates the user’s balance (`sum[msg.sender]`).
    - Updates the total balance (`Sum`).
    - Transfers the specified amount of collateral from the user to the contract.


#### 3. **`burn`**:

- **Purpose**: Burns all collateral held by the contract, reducing the total supply of the token.


 In the `fire` function, you're calling `deny(proxy)` **as part of the emergency shutdown** to prevent the proxy from interfering with the process. The system is being shut down, and the proxy should not be allowed to perform any further actions.

 In the `denyProxy` function, you're calling `deny(proxy)` to **explicitly revoke permissions** for the proxy in a more isolated, controlled manner, possibly without shutting down the entire system. It's more about removing the proxy's authority from a specific context, without invoking a complete shutdown of the system.
